HELLO WORLD!

This is a little website I made part of the cs50 course. I decided to do a website for the the company I currently work for. I wanted to include a navigation bar, contact form, list and few images. Although this website is far from what I would consider a "website" I think it was a good experience for me. 


This was a really good test of my knowledge and really challenged me to outsource and learn new things to further deepen my understanding in HTML and CSS. I also really enjoyed using BOOTSTRAP grid system and SASS.
